# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. The goal is to use statistical and machine learning techniques to identify key factors associated with diabetes and build a model that can help in early detection and prevention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains information about various health indicators and whether individuals have diabetes. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies the individual has had.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2).
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that describes the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Outcome**: Whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Explore and understand the dataset.
   - Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Select and preprocess relevant features for the model.
   - Normalize or standardize features if necessary.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Develop various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM).
   - Train and evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Perform cross-validation to assess model performance.
   - Analyze model results to determine the best performing model.
